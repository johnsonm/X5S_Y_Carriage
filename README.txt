# Summary

For the TronXY X5S I have designed some upgrade parts. Mainly to improve the gantry which uses Acrylic parts which flex and break easily, the stock idlers and belt path.

See short video clip:
https://youtu.be/3yFbaJzWN30
<br>
The stock belt path is nowhere near parallel and perpendicular where needed, so I designed custom Corner Idler Plates. Added ridges and counter sunk extrusion cur outs to make it more sturdy.

The four wheeled Y carriages have basically one wheel too many, three make a plane. During movement I could see wheels not turning at all due to the forces on the plates. The 3 Wheeler solves that as well. Added ridges and counter sunk extrusion cur outs to make it more sturdy.

[EDIT 1]
If you want to use eccentric nuts for the outer wheels, see the great remix that Joar shared:

_Parts included and needed:_

_Printed parts_ (I printed them at 0.28 layer height, 4 top/bottom/perimeters with 80% full Honeycomb Infill):

- 2x X5S_Y-carriage_3w_ridged_spacers.stl ('3 Wheeler edition' with ridges and integrated wheel spacers)
- 1x Corner_Idlers_Plate.stl ('as is' for Front Left side)
- 1x Corner_Idlers_Plate_mirrored.stl (mirrored in XY for Front Right side)
- 8x M5_holder_608_bearing.stl (when you gonna use them as idlers)
- 8x 608_bearing_sleeve.stl (when you gonna use them as idlers)
<br>
The following files you can download at SgaboLab, the designer of them. Check out his other great upgrades for the X5S as well!:

<br>
- 2x spacer A1-spessore-cuscinetto-cinghie-carrelli-8e4mm.stl (under high idlers on Y carriage)
- 2x spacer C-spessore-torri-cuscinetto-20x8e4.stl (under high idlers on Corner Idler Plates, print them 1mm lowered in Z height --> 7mm high)
- 1x B2-staffa-cart-estrusore-V2.stl (for X Carriage belt riser)
- 3x B1-spessore-ruote-ext-6mm.stl (for X Carriage Wheels)
<br>

_Hardware needed:_

- 8x 608zz bearing (if you do not have 'official idlers' planned already and you gonna use them as idlers)
- 4x M5x50 screws
- 3x M5x40 screws
- 1x M5x35 screws (re-use from kit)
- 2x M5x30 screws (re-use from kit)
- 10x M5 washers medium size
- 12x M5 washers small size (re-use from kit)
- 4x M4x16 screws
- 4x M4x9 screws (re-use from kit)
- 8x M4 washers medium size
- 12x M4 washers small size (re-use from kit)
- 8x T-nuts (re-use from kit)
<br>

_Instructions and parts used:_

Y-Carriage:

For assembling the mirrored right side corner idler plate, use your free side cutters to snip off part of the outside ridge where the end stop plate is mounted to make it fit. See photo.

Front Left corner idler plate:
- high idler: M5x50 screwed into frame,  
- low idler: use the M5x25 from the frame

Front Right corner idler plate:
- high idler: use a M5x40 (the M5x35 from stock wheel setup is just too short) 
- low idler: M5x50 screwed into frame

Use M4x16 with M4 medium washers and the hammer nuts to mount the plates to the extrusion.
